                  <h3>Rajma</h3>
                  <p>Rajma is a tremendous source of soluble fibre which helps lower cholesterol levels.

                        <h3>Roganjosh</h3>
                        <p> RoganJosh,a staple of Kashmiri cuisine is a must try.
                          Though known for its piquant taste, the first thing which hits you is the aroma of the blend of spices used to cook the lamb.
                          The distinct color imparted by the Kashmiri Mirch, that is de-seeded to reduce the heat, makes for a mouth-watering sight imploring you to gorge on the delicacy. Another option for the spice lovers is the Rajasthani Laal Maans. Mutton laced with flavors of hot spices is cooked with a generous helping of curd to balance the sharpness of the chilies.</p>
